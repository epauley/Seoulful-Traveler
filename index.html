		</div>

	<div class="description">
			<p>Hello, my name is Beth.  I studied abroad in South Korea for four months and have gained a lot of travel experience and "knowledge" that I want to share with you.  There are so many things to say but for the purpose of this website I am going to limit it advice on places to travel in Seoul.  These are just my recommended top five and they are a good place to start your planning.  There are hundreds of other things to do so don't be afraid to just go looking around.  Being in Seoul is just one big adventure.^^</p>
			<p>Also depending on the weather conditions some of these places might not be as enjoyable.  If you are not planning on staying very long, it is highly recommended that you visit in the fall or spring.  In the winter it is bitter cold and in the summer it rains almost every day because it is their rainy season.</p>
			<p>I would also like to note that I only provided direction via the subway.  This is the most visitor friendly way to travel if you do not read or speak Korean.  I don't really recommend taking the bus in Korea because from a foreigner perspective as they can be scary.  The drivers are very aggressive and will go through red lights.  However, Seoul has update most of their buses to display the stops in multiple languages but the buses on the outer edge of Seoul do not.  So unless you know how to read Korean like I do, the bus system could be confusing.</p>
			<p>Hope this helps with your planning and enjoy Korea!!!</p>

	</div>

	<div class="description">
		<p>Want to step back in time?  Then Gyeongbokgung Palace it an excellent choice for you. Gyeongbokgung was built three years after the Joseon Dynasty was founded and it served as its main palace. With Mount Bugaksan as a backdrop, Gyeongbokgung was situated in the heart of the Korean capital city. It was steadily expanded before being reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion of 1592. For the next 273 years the palace grounds were left derelict until being rebuilt in 1867 under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon Daewongun. The restoration was completed on a grand scale, with 330 buildings crowded together in a labyrinthine configuration. Within the palace walls were the Outer Court (oejeon), offices for the king and state officials, and the Inner Court (naejeon), which included living quarters for the royal family as well as gardens for leisure. Within its extensive precincts were other palaces, large and small, including Junggung (the Queen`s residence) and Donggung (the Crown prince's residence). Owing to its status as the symbol of national sovereignty, Gyeongbokgung was again demolished during the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century. In 1911, ownership of land at the palace was transferred to the Japanese Governor-General. In 1915, on the pretext of holding an exhibition, more than 90% of the buildings were torn down. Following the exhibition the Japanese leveled whatever still remained and built their colonial headquarters, the Government-General Building (1916-26), on the site. Restoration of Gyeongbokgung to its former glory has been ongoing since 1990 and as of 2013 it is estimated that it will take another 20 years to complete it.</p>
		<p>Remember to check out the Changing of the Guard ceremony, The National Palace Museum of Korea which is located south of Heungnyemun Gate, and the National Folk Museum which is located east within Hyangwonjeong.  Tickets for Gyeongbokgung Palace give you access to these Museums without additional cost.</p>
		<p>The Changing of the Guard ceremony takes place at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 between Gwanghwamun Gate and Heungnyemun Gate. Cost is free.</p>

	  </div>
	</div>

	<div style="position:relative;">
	  <div class="description" >
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>This is a great place to visit because the streets are alive with activity and full of Korean character since it is the largest market of traditional Korean art and products.  There are daily calligraphy demonstrations and pansori performances (Korean traditional music).  Not to mention there is amazing shopping.
			</p>
			<p>Once you are in Insa-dong, you will immediately be drawn to various shops and galleries.  There are antique shops, Korean stationery stores, frame shops, handicraft shops, pottery and porcelain shops, bookstores and painting studios, and art supply stores. Forty percent of all antique stores in Korea can be found in Insa-dong.  In addition, restaurants and cafes serve traditional food and teas.
			</p>
			<p>You will also undoubtedly find old photographs, pottery, wooden containers, jewelry, ceramics and earthenware.  While some of the authentic antiques will be out of the price range of most tourists, there is no shortage of stores selling souvenirs and facsimiles of traditional Korean cultural items.
			</p>
			<p>I also recommend visiting on the weekend because automobile traffic is not allowed on the streets then so there is higher chance of see cultural festivities like parades, traditional wedding processions, traditional musical, dance performances, etc. because the streets are not block by traffic.
			</p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Insadong was originally two towns whose names ended in the syllables "In" and "Sa". They were divided by a stream which ran along Insadong's current main street. Insadong began 500 years ago as an area of residence for government officials.  During the Japanese occupation, the wealthy Korean residents were forced to move and sell their belongings, at which point the site became an area of trading in antiques. After the end of the Korean War, the area became a focus of South Korea's artistic and cafe life.  It was a popular destination among foreign visitors to South Korea during the 1960s, who called the area "Mary's Alley".  It gained in popularity with international tourists during the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</p>
			<h3>Getting There:</h3>
			<p>Take the subway line number 3 to Anguk Station.  From there take exit number 6, walk straight for about a block, and you will see it to your left.  You can also take subway line number 1 to either Jonggak Station or Jongno 3-ga Station.</p>

			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Olympic Park was originally built for the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and nowadays offers visiters a wide range of cultural, sporting and leisure opportunities. Because Olympic Park is so large I recommend going early and familiarize yourselves with entrances and exits and travel routes before they go.  Takes at least three hours to cover the whole park.</p>
			<p>Olympic Park is divided into four zones: arts and culture, recreation and sport, environment and history. In the northwest of the park are the environment and history zones featuring a walking trail along the ancient fortress and places to learn about the natural world. In the southern part of the park, the arts and culture zone is home to the SOMA Museum of Art and an outdoor sculpture park. In fact, Olympic Park is one of the world's top 5 sculpture parks featuring over 200 sculptures by national and international artists including both famous names and emerging talents.</p>
			<h3>Sculptures throughout the park</h3>
			<p>At the entrance to the park is a plaza with a World Peace Gate at its center. This Peace Plaza has long served as a place for visitors to unwind and is also popular for inline skating. The Olympic Flame below the gate, which was lit during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, has continued to burn ever since.</p>
			<h3>Cultural Art Park</h3>
			<p>The Cultural Art Park is a place where visitors can enjoy diverse cultural experiences and performances. The park also features the Olympic Museum, the Seoul Olympics Museum of Art (SOMA) one of the world's top five sculpture museums' and Music Fountain.</p>
			<h3>Leisure Sports Park</h3>
			<p>This area is comprised of the Sports Square (walking/jogging paths, an acupressure path, inline skating area, etc.) and Peace Square (a pleasant area with a wide variety of activities and sports lessons).</p>
			<h3>Environmental Eco-Park</h3>
			<p>Environmental Eco-Park Persistent efforts have succeeded in restoring natural splendor to this place where a equally splendid civilization once blossomed. People and nature co-exist comfortably within the Environmental Eco-Park, which has become home to families of spot-billed ducks, white herons, cuckoos, pheasants, Korean squirrels, chipmunks, and frogs. More recent efforts to rejuvenate the local ecosystem have resulted in the appearance of woodpeckers and raccoons, both of which are rarely spotted in cities. The croaking of small round frogs can now be heard within the park as well.</p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Visitors to the park can experience Korean history firsthand at the Mongchontoseong Fortress and the Baekje Museum, while hearkening back to the more recent, grand spirit of the Olympics in the Holy Land of Peace.</p>
			<h5>Getting There</h5>
